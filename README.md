A deep learning pipeline for emotion classification using facial images, featuring transfer learning with ResNet50 and SVM classification.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Uses pre-trained ResNet50 for efficient feature extraction
- **Optimized Pipeline**: Custom image size (220Ã—220) for best accuracy/performance balance
- **Model Choices**: 
  - SVM with linear kernel (best performance in testing)
  - Alternative neural network options available
- **Reproducible**: Fixed random seeds (42) for consistent results
- **Efficient Processing**: Batch image processing with progress tracking
